My research focuses on the intersection of applied machine learning and strategic innovation management, with a commitment to addressing complex business challenges and fostering competitive advantage. In the domain of applied machine learning, I specialize in forecasting, non-intrusive load monitoring, and time-series analysis, with applications in predictive maintenance and power grid optimization. Within strategic innovation management, my interests lie in developing innovative business models, crafting strategic roadmaps, and advancing effective innovation management practices to drive organizational success in dynamic markets.
