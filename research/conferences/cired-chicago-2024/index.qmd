## Abstract

This paper presents a probabilistic forecasting approach tailored for low voltage (LV) substations, offering short-term predictions for three crucial variables: voltage, reactive power, and active power. These parameters play a vital role in the resilience of distribution systems, especially in the presence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Evaluation with simulated data shows that active and reactive power forecasts degrade notably with higher EV penetration, whereas voltage forecasting experiences less degradation across all scenarios.
