    "text": "Introduction\nA company has recently installed a new, expensive machine. A critical question arises: How long will it last before failure?. The lead engineer, drawing on experience with previous models, estimates a lifespan of approximately 10 years. However, only 3 months of real-world test data are available for this specific unit, and a major warranty and service contract decision must be made immediately.\nThis scenario exemplifies a common challenge in industrial applications: making informed decisions with limited data. Bayesian thinking offers a powerful framework to address such problems by combining prior knowledge with observed data to update our beliefs about uncertain parameters.\nIn this article, we will explore the fundamentals of Bayesian thinking and how it can be applied to industrial scenarios like the one described above. We will cover key concepts such as prior distributions, likelihood functions, and posterior distributions, and demonstrate how to implement Bayesian models using Python‚Äôs PyMC library.\n\n\nThe Building Blocks of Bayesian modeling\nTraditional (Frequentist) statistics relies on large datasets the ‚Äúlong run‚Äù to produce confident conclusions, a limitation in industrial contexts where data are often sparse. New products, machines, or processes typically generate only small samples, while valuable expert knowledge such as an engineer‚Äôs lifespan estimate is excluded from conventional models.\nBayesian inference overcomes these issues by combining prior knowledge with new data, enabling faster and more informed decisions when information is limited. This integration of expertise and evidence defines Bayesian thinking.\nThe process of updating our beliefs is formalized by Bayes‚Äô Theorem. \\[\nP(\\theta \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid \\theta) P(\\theta)}{P(D)}\n\\]\nWhile the formula looks mathematical, its components represent a beautifully intuitive learning cycle.\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Posterior} \\propto \\mathrm{Likelihood} \\times \\mathrm{Prior}\n\\]\nLet us break down how this relates to our machine failure problem; where \\(\\theta\\) is the machine‚Äôs expected failure rate, and \\(D\\) is the 3 months of test data.\n\nPrior, Likelihood, and Posterior\n\nPrior \\(P(\\theta)\\) represents the initial belief before observing any data. It incorporates domain expertise and historical knowledge. For instance, historical records may indicate that similar machines have an average lifespan of approximately ten years, implying a low failure rate. This prior belief defines the starting point for ùúÉ \\(\\theta\\).\nLikelihood \\(P(D \\mid \\theta)\\) quantifies the compatibility between the observed data and a given parameter value. It expresses the probability of observing the test outcomes for different possible failure rates. In this context, the likelihood measures how probable it is to observe zero failures within three months if the true average lifespan were, for example, five or fifteen years.\nPosterior \\(P(\\theta \\mid D)\\) represents the updated belief after incorporating the observed data. It integrates prior knowledge with the evidence provided by the likelihood. In the machine-failure example, the posterior distribution expresses the updated estimate of expected lifespan after combining historical information (e.g., the ten-year prior) with the three months of failure-free operational data.\n\n\n\nPyMC: The Probabilistic Programming Engine\nUnderstanding the relationship \\(\\mathrm{Posterior} \\propto \\mathrm{Likelihood} \\times \\mathrm{Prior}\\) is the conceptual heart of Bayesian analysis. However, calculating the actual posterior distribution, $ P(D) $, often involves complex, multi-dimensional integration that is impossible to solve analytically for real-world industrial problems. This challenge is addressed through Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) such as PyMC.\nPyMC is an open-source Python library for constructing and fitting Bayesian statistical models using advanced computational algorithms, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference. It is one of several modern PPLs available in Python, alongside Pyro and TensorFlow Probability (TFP). This tutorial focuses on PyMC due to its clarity, community support, and extensive documentation.\n\n\n\nCase study: A/B Testing with Small Samples\nTo shift from theory to practical implementation, we will apply the Bayesian building blocks Prior, Likelihood, and Posterior to a concrete industrial problem common in tech and e-commerce: A/B Testing\n\nSuppose you are a data scientist at an e-commerce company. The marketing team just launched a new website feature and wants to know:\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs the true conversion rate?\nIs it better than the old version (which historically has an 8% conversion rate)?\nHow much should we trust this estimate with limited data?\n\n\nDuring the first few days of the feature launch, the company has observed 200 visitors with only 15 conversion.\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#import libraries\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=UserWarning)\nimport pymc as pm\nimport arviz as az\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output\nfrom great_tables import GT\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\naz.style.use(\"arviz-white\")\nfrom cycler import cycler\ncolors=['#107591','#f69a48','#00c0bf', '#fdcd49',\"#cf166e\", \n        \"#7035b7\", \"#212121\",\"#757575\", \"#E0E0E0\",\"#FAFAFA\"]\nplt.rcParams.update({\n    \"figure.dpi\": 100,\n    \"axes.labelsize\": 12,\n    \"axes.titlesize\": 12,\n    \"figure.titlesize\": 12,\n        \"font.size\": 12,\n        \"legend.fontsize\": 12,\n        \"xtick.labelsize\": 12,\n        \"ytick.labelsize\": 12,\n        \"axes.linewidth\" : 0.5,\n        \"lines.linewidth\" : 1.,\n        \"legend.frameon\" :False,\n        'axes.prop_cycle': cycler(color=colors)\n        \n})\nimport altair \naltair.themes.enable('carbonwhite')\nimport altair as alt\nalt.data_transformers.enable('default', max_rows=None)\nclear_output()\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# For reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# A/B Test Parameters\nvisitors = 200\nconversions = 15\nobserved_conversion_rate = conversions / visitors\nhistorical_baseline = 0.08\n\n\n\nDefine Prior, likelihood, and Posterior in PyMC\nTo model this problem in PyMC, one must first define the Prior and Likelihood distributions\nPrior: Since the conversion rate \\(\\theta\\), can only range between 0 and 1. The Beta distribution is ideal for modeling parameters that are bounded between 0 and 1, such as probabilities or rates.\nThe Beta distribution is controlled by two parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). hese parameters are set to formally encode the prior knowledge: the historical 8% conversion rate. The mean of a \\(\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) distribution is \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{ \\alpha + \\beta}\\). Since the historical rate is 8% (or 0.08), we need to choose \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) such that: \\[\n\\frac{\\alpha}{ \\alpha + \\beta} = 0.08\n\\]\nTo determine the strength of this belief, a number that represents the effective sample size (ESS) of the historical knowledge is chosen. Choosing a hypothetical ESS of 100 trials, we can solve for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\): - ESS \\(= \\alpha + \\beta = 100\\) - \\(\\alpha\\) (hypothetical successes) \\(=100√ó0.08=8\\) - \\(\\beta\\) (hypothetical failures) \\(=100‚àí8=92\\)\nLikelihood the Likelihood is determined by the process that generated the data. Since there is a fixed number of trials (N=200 visitors) and the number of successes (k=15 conversions) is counted, this is a Binomial distribution.\n\n\nShow the code\nwith pm.Model() as conversion_model:\n    # Prior distribution based on historical performance\n    conversion_rate = pm.Beta(\"conversion_rate\", alpha=8, beta=92)\n    \n    # Likelihood function\n    likelihood = pm.Binomial(\"observations\", n=visitors, p=conversion_rate, observed=conversions)\n    \n    # Sample from posterior distribution\n    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, chains=4, random_seed=42, return_inferencedata=True)\n\nclear_output()\n\n\nThis small block of code above defines and runs our entire Bayesian analysis. For those seeing PyMC for the first time, here is what each section is doing:\n\nwith pm.Model() as model: This block acts as a container for all the random variables and data in our model. Everything inside this context belongs to the conversion_model\nconversion_rate = pm.Beta(...): We are telling PyMC that the true conversion_rate is a random variable, and our initial belief is described by the Beta(8,92) distribution.\nlikelihood = pm.Binomial(...): This defines the process that generated our observed data. We link the conversion_rate parameter to the actual observed data (n=visitors, observed=conversions) using the appropriate Binomial distribution.\npm.sample(...): This is where the magic happens! The pm.sample function runs the MCMC sampler (the computational engine) to combine the Prior and the Likelihood, effectively calculating the Posterior distribution. We ask the sampler to draw 2000 samples after a 1000-sample tuning period, running 4 independent chains to ensure reliable results.\n\n\n\n\nModel diagnostics\nRunning pm.sample() generates the raw output, but the job isn‚Äôt done yet. Before we trust the results, we must perform Model Diagnostics to ensure our computational engine (the MCMC sampler) has worked correctly. The single most important diagnostic check is confirming Convergence.\n\nModel Convergencevergence\nIn Bayesian inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are employed to sample from the complex posterior distribution. These samples are relied upon to accurately estimate quantities like the mean conversion rate or its credible interval.\nConvergence is the guarantee that the MCMC chains have explored the entire distribution and are now producing samples that truly represent the target Posterior distribution, and are not just stuck in a starting location.\n\nAnalogy: Imagine trying to understand the shape of a deep, misty valley (the posterior). If your chains haven‚Äôt converged, they might be stuck high up on a ridge, missing the true, deep center. Diagnostics are the tools we use to confirm the chains have found and are walking across the bottom of the true valley.\n\nPyMC uses the supporting library ArviZ for standardizing and analyzing the results, which provides the following diagnostics and plots\n\nTrace Plots: Visual inspection of parameter samples across iterations.\n\nGood trace plots look like fuzzy caterpillars with no trends or jumps.\n\nR-hat (Gelman-Rubin Statistic): Measures how well multiple chains agree.\n\nR-hat ‚âà 1 means convergence.\nR-hat &gt; 1.01 suggests problems.\n\nEffective Sample Size (ESS): Indicates how many independent samples you effectively have.\n\nLow ESS means poor mixing or autocorrelation. Good ESS is typically &gt; 200 per parameter.\n\n\nThe most efficient way to check convergence numerically is using the ArviZ summary function, specifically asking for the diagnostics az.summary(trace, kind=\"diagnostics\"). Alternatively, az.plot_trace(trace) can be used to get a visual sense of convergence.\n\nExample Diagnostic Output\n\n\nShow the code\ndiag_table=az.summary(trace, kind=\"diagnostics\")[['ess_bulk', 'ess_tail', 'r_hat']]\nGT(diag_table).tab_header(\n    title=\"\",\n    subtitle=\"Conversion Rate Model\"\n).cols_label({\n        'ess_bulk': 'ESS Bulk',\n        'ess_tail': 'ESS Tail.',\n        'r_hat': 'R-hat',\n    })\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversion Rate Model\n\n\nESS Bulk\nESS Tail.\nR-hat\n\n\n\n\n3966.0\n5559.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table immediately indicates that the model is reliable and ready for analysis\n\n(R_hat = 1.0,Goal Achieved): Since R_hat is exactly 1.0, this confirms that the four independent MCMC chains have fully converged and agree on the shape of the posterior distribution. The model is reliable.\nESS bulk ‚Äãand ESS tail (3966.0 and 5559.0, Goal Achieved): Both effective sample sizes are significantly greater than the ‚â•400 minimum threshold. This means there are plenty of high-quality, effectively independent samples to accurately estimate the mean, mode, and credible intervals of the true conversion rate.\n\n\nVisual Check: Trace Plots\nWhile the numbers in the summary table are essential, visually inspecting the MCMC chains confirms the story.\n\n\nShow the code\naz.plot_trace(trace);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trace plot above shows excellent convergence for our conversion rate (\\(\\theta\\)) model, supporting the conclusions from our quantitative diagnostics. The plot is split into two panels 1. Right Panel: MCMC Sampling Behavior\n\nThis panel shows the raw sampled values across iterations for each of our four chains. The sampled values oscillate stably around ‚àº0.075 (7.5%) without any noticeable trends, sudden jumps, or long-term drifts.\nThe different lines (chains) are thoroughly intertwined and overlap completely. This ‚Äúfuzzy caterpillar‚Äù appearance is the visual proof that the sampler is efficiently exploring the parameter space and that all chains have converged to the same distribution.\nThe stable behavior confirms the chain has reached stationarity, meaning it is now sampling from the true, converged Posterior distribution.\n\n\nLeft Panel: Posterior Distribution\n\nThis panel shows the estimated Posterior probability density function (PDF) based on the samples. The shape is smooth and unimodal (single peak), indicating a well-behaved posterior without ambiguity.\nThe peak is clearly centered at a value close to our observed rate (7.5%), which is what we expect when combining a prior (8%) and data (7.5%).\nThe spread of the distribution clearly visualizes our remaining uncertainty about the true conversion rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior Predictive Checks: Validating Model Assumptions\nWhile we have demonstrated that the convergence of the fitted model a complete Bayesian analysis requires us to first validate the assumptions we made before seeing any data (priors). This validation is accomplished through the Prior Predictive Check.\n\nPrior Predictive Checks helps validate the prior assumptions before fitting the model to data. It show what kind of data the model expects to generate based solely on the prior beliefs.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nwith pm.Model() as conversion_model:\n    # Prior distribution based on historical performance\n    conversion_rate = pm.Beta(\"conversion_rate\", alpha=8, beta=92)\n    \n    # Likelihood function\n    likelihood = pm.Binomial(\"observations\", n=visitors, p=conversion_rate, observed=conversions)\n\n\nGiven our prior belief of an 8% conversion rate, we can simulate what kind of data we would expect to see if this belief were true. This is done by generating synthetic datasets from the prior distribution and comparing them to the actual observed data. This is acomplished in PyMC by running pm.sample_prior_predictive() function.\n\n\nShow the code\nwith conversion_model:\n    prior_pred = pm.sample_prior_predictive()\n\n\nSampling: [conversion_rate, observations]\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nfig, ax=plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 2.8))\naz.plot_ppc(prior_pred, group=\"prior\", ax=ax)\nplt.xlabel('conversions')\nplt.ylabel('Density');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe generated plot from the prior predictive sampling shows the distributions of simulated data (the number of conversions) created by sampling from the \\(\\text{Beta}(8,92)\\) prior distribution. - The distribution of the simulated data (prior predictive line) appear broadly spread out and relatively flat across a wide range (0 to 40+ conversions). This indicates that the prior allows for many different outcomes, and thus it is not overly restrictive. - The dashed line represents the average predicted number of conversions It is also quite flat and non-committal. - It evident that the prior predictive distribution does not overly concentrate around any specific number of conversions, which is desirable when we want to remain open to various possible outcomes. - So the prior predictive check confirms that our chosen Beta(8,92) prior is reasonable though it also quite weakly informative how?\nRed flags to watch for: - Impossible values: Predictions outside the feasible range (e.g., negative conversion, &gt;200 observations) - Unrealistic concentrations: If priors are too informative, you might see all predictions clustered in a narrow range - Poor scaling: Predictions that don‚Äôt match the scale of your problem\n\n\nShow the code\n# Test different prior beliefs\npriors_to_test = [\n    (\"Very Optimistic\", 15, 85),    # Believes 15% conversion rate\n    (\"Optimistic\", 12, 88),         # Believes 12% conversion rate  \n    (\"Historical Based\", 8, 92),    # Our original prior (8%)\n    ('Strong Historical', 80, 920),      # Mean = 0.08, ESS = 1000\n    (\"Skeptical\", 4, 96),           # Believes 4% conversion rate\n    (\"Uninformative\", 1, 1),        # Let data dominate completely\n]\n\npriors_df = pd.DataFrame()\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(15, 6), sharex=True)\naxes = axes.flatten()\nfor idx, (prior_name, alpha, beta) in enumerate(priors_to_test):\n    with pm.Model() as sensitivity_model:\n        conversion_rate = pm.Beta(\"conversion_rate\", alpha=alpha, beta=beta)\n        likelihood = pm.Binomial(\"observations\", n=visitors, p=conversion_rate, observed=conversions)\n        \n    with sensitivity_model:\n        prior_pred = pm.sample_prior_predictive()\n    \n    # Plot posterior\n    df=pd.DataFrame({\"Posterior\":prior_pred.stack(sample=(\"chain\", \"draw\")).prior['conversion_rate'],\n                        \"Prior\":prior_name})\n    priors_df=pd.concat([priors_df,df])\n    \n    #az.plot_ppc(prior_pred, group='prior',ax=axes[idx])\n    az.plot_posterior(prior_pred, group='prior', ax=axes[idx], hdi_prob=0.95)\n    axes[idx].set_title(f'{prior_name} Prior\\nŒ±={alpha}, Œ≤={beta}')\nfig.suptitle('Prior Predictive Checks by Prior Belief', y=1.02)\nplt.tight_layout()\nclear_output()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n\n\ndomain = [\"Very Optimistic\", \"Optimistic\", \"Historical Based\", \"Strong Historical\", \"Skeptical\", \"Uninformative\"]\nreference_data = pd.DataFrame([\n    {'x': 0.08, 'label': 'Old Feature CR (8%)', 'color': 'red', 'label_x': 0.08},\n    {'x': 0.075, 'label': 'New Feature CR (7.5%)', 'color': 'green', 'label_x': 0.075}\n])\nchart = alt.Chart(priors_df).transform_density(density='Posterior', groupby=['Prior'], as_=['Posterior', 'density'])\\\n    .mark_line(opacity=0.5)\\\n    .encode(x='Posterior:Q', \n            y='density:Q', \n            color=alt.Color(\"Prior:N\").scale(domain=domain, range=colors[:len(domain)])\n            )\n\n\nreference_lines = alt.Chart(reference_data).mark_rule(\n    strokeDash=[5, 5], # Dashed line\n    size=1, \n).encode(\n    x='x:Q',\n    color=alt.Color('label:N', \n                    scale=alt.Scale(domain=reference_data['label'].tolist(), \n                                    range=reference_data['color'].tolist()),\n                    legend=alt.Legend(title=\"Conversion Rate\"))\n)\n\n\nfinal=chart + reference_lines \nfinal=final.properties(title='Prior Distributions by Prior Belief', width=900, height=300).configure_axis(\n    # Set grid to False to remove all grid lines\n    grid=False\n).configure_view(\n    # Optional: Remove the surrounding border of the plot area\n    strokeWidth=0 \n)\nfinal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior Predictive Checks\nPosterior Predictive Checks addresses the important test: Does the model actually make sense given the data observed?\nThis moves the process from confirming the samplers or priors to validating the model itself.\n\nPPCs evaluate model fit by comparing the observed data to simulated data from the posterior distribution. If a model accurately represents the data-generating process, the simulated data should resemble the actual observations.\n\nTo achive this it is important to generate new, simulated data from the posterior distribution and compare it to the actual observed data. This is done using the pm.sample_posterior_predictive function in PyMC.\n\n\nShow the code\nwith pm.Model() as conversion_model:\n    # Prior distribution based on historical performance\n    conversion_rate = pm.Beta(\"conversion_rate\", alpha=8, beta=92)\n    \n    # Likelihood function\n    likelihood = pm.Binomial(\"observations\", n=visitors, p=conversion_rate, observed=conversions)\n    \n    # Sample from posterior distribution\n    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, chains=4, random_seed=42, return_inferencedata=True)\n\n\nwith conversion_model:\n    posterior_pred = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=42,)\n    \nclear_output()\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nppc_summary = az.summary(posterior_pred, kind='stats', hdi_prob=0.95)\nppc_table = (\n    GT(ppc_summary)\n    .cols_label({\n        'mean': 'Mean',\n        'sd': 'Std-Dev.',\n        'hdi_2.5%': 'HDI 3%',\n        'hdi_97.5%': 'HDI 97%'\n    }).tab_header(\n        title=\"Posterior Predictive Summary Statistics\",\n        subtitle=\"\"\n    )\n)\nppc_table \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior Predictive Summary Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\nStd-Dev.\nHDI 3%\nHDI 97%\n\n\n\n\n15.314\n4.806\n6.0\n24.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt clear that the predicted mean (15.314) is extremely close to the actual observed count (15). This is a strong indication that the conversion_rate model fits the data very well. And thus the choice of the Beta Prior and Binomial Likelihood is appropriate for this data. The model predicts that 95% of the time, the number of conversions will fall between 6 and 24. Since the company observed value of 15 falls well within this 95% HDI, the actual observation is considered highly plausible according to your model.\n\n\nShow the code\nppc_samples = posterior_pred.posterior_predictive['observations'].values.flatten()\npercentile = (ppc_samples &lt;= conversions).mean() * 100\nprint(f\"Observed convervation ({conversions}) is at the {percentile:.1f}th percentile of predictions\")\n\n\nObserved convervation (15) is at the 53.7th percentile of predictions\n\n\nThe value of 53.7 is very close to the ideal 50, which provides further strong evidence (in addition to the mean of 15.314 already seen) that:\n\nThe model is not biased (it is not systematically over- or under-estimating the data).\nThe choice of the Beta-Binomial model is highly appropriate for this data set.\n\n\n\n\nModel Utility and Business Decision\nFollowing the confirmation of the reliability of the Bayesian model through the Posterior Predictive Check (PPC), the focus now shifts from ‚ÄúDoes the model fit the data?‚Äù to the commercially critical question: ‚ÄúIs the model useful for making business decisions?‚Äù\nSpecifically, the derived posterior distribution is utilized to quantify the evidence that the new feature‚Äôs conversion rate (Feature B) is superior to the existing, established conversion rate (Feature A, which has a known baseline rate of 0.08).\nTo achieve this, we need to extract the posterior distribution for the conversion_rate parameter that your model estimated.\n\n\nShow the code\nposterior_samples = trace.posterior.stack(sample=(\"chain\", \"draw\"))\nconversion_samples=posterior_samples['conversion_rate'].values\n\n\nNext, calculate the ‚Äúprobability of superiority‚Äù‚Äîthe probability that the new feature (B) is better than the old (A).\nFinally, the expected uplift in conversion rate can be computed and translated into business value. This involves calculating the difference between the posterior mean conversion rate and the historical rate, then multiplying by the number of visitors and average revenue per conversion.\n\n0.95: Strong Evidence. The new feature is very likely superior. Launching it should be considered.\n0.80: Moderate Evidence. The new feature is likely better, but there is still a 20% chance it is worse. The decision depends on company risk tolerance.\n0.50: No Evidence. The new feature is a toss-up; there is no statistical reason to prefer it over the old feature.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nprob_superiority = (conversion_samples &gt; historical_baseline).mean()\n# Display the result\nprint(f\"The probability that the new feature is better than the old rate (0.08) is: {prob_superiority:.1%}\")\n\n\nThe probability that the new feature is better than the old rate (0.08) is: 39.7%\n\n\nThe calculated Probability of Superiority is approximately 0.40, indicating that there is a 40% chance the new feature‚Äôs conversion rate is better than the old feature‚Äôs with 8% rate. This imply that there is a 60.3% chance the new feature is worse than the baseline.\nSince the probability that the new feature is superior is well below the neutral benchmark of 50%, the data does not support replacing the existing Feature A with the new Feature B based on conversion rate alone. The new feature is highly likely to perform worse.\n\nProbability of Meaningful Improvement.\nDepending on the business context, one might also want to calculate the probability that the new feature is better by a meaningful margin (e.g., &gt;1% improvement). This calculates the chance that the new feature is better than the old feature by a practically significant margin of at least 1 percentage point. This is a crucial business metric. Sometimes a tiny statistical ‚Äúwin‚Äù is not worth the cost of development and deployment. If this probability is low, it confirms the feature is not a major improvement.\n\n\nShow the code\nprob_1pct_improvement = (conversion_samples &gt; historical_baseline+0.01).mean()\nprint(f\" Probability of &gt;1% improvement: {prob_1pct_improvement:.1%}\")\n\n\n Probability of &gt;1% improvement: 18.4%\n\n\n\n\nProbability of Hitting a Target Rate\nThis calculates the chance that the true conversion rate of the new feature is 10% or higher. This is useful if 10% is a specific, ambitious KPI (Key Performance Indicator) or goal set by the marketing or product team. It tells how likely the team is to meet its goal.\n\n\nShow the code\nprob_10pct = (conversion_samples &gt; 0.10).mean()\nprint(f\" Probability of &gt;10% improvement: {prob_10pct:.1%}\")\n\n\n Probability of &gt;10% improvement: 6.3%\n\n\n\nExpected Value of the Change.\nThis is the single-number best estimate of the average change (positive or negative) to expect upon deploying the new feature. This is the foundation for the ‚ÄúExpected Business Impact‚Äù section. If this value is negative, it represents an Expected Loss.\nIf one calculates: expected_uplift√óTotal¬†Visitors√óARPC, the estimated dollar value of the change is obtained.\nThe goal is to translate the statistically determined average change in conversion rate into a clear financial outcome for the business. This calculation provides the most actionable insight for the go/no-go decision on the new feature.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Calculate key business probabilities\nexpected_uplift = conversion_samples.mean() - historical_baseline\n\n# Calculate expected business impact\nmonthly_visitors = 10000\nexpected_additional_conversions = monthly_visitors * expected_uplift\nconversion_value = 50  # Average value per conversion\nexpected_monthly_value = expected_additional_conversions * conversion_value\n\nprint(f\"Expected uplift: {expected_uplift:.3f} ({expected_uplift:.1%} points)\")\nprint(f\"Expected monthly value: ${expected_monthly_value:,.0f}\")\n\n\nExpected uplift: -0.003 (-0.3% points)\nExpected monthly value: $-1,717\n\n\nWe see that the expected uplift is -0.030 (-3.0% points), indicating that, on average, the new feature is expected to decrease the conversion rate by 3 percentage points. The expected financial consequence of deploying the new feature is a loss of $1,717 per month\nThe data suggests that deploying the new feature would likely result in an Expected Monthly Loss of $1,717. This financial quantification is the most compelling reason to reject the new feature based on conversion rate performance.\nThe decision to proceed should only be considered if the feature provides other, unquantified benefits (e.g., improved customer retention, compliance, or brand value) that are estimated to be worth more than $1,717 per month.\n\n\n\nPrior sensitivity analysis\nAssessing how the choice of prior influences the final decision is important. This transparency is a key strength of Bayesian modeling, as it allows testing every assumption. Thus, one must determine how much the choice of prior affects the outcome by comparing several Beta priors. These comparisons will include priors from very optimistic (expecting a \\(15\\%\\) conversion rate) to skeptical (expecting only \\(4\\%\\)), plus an uninformative prior that lets the data speak entirely for itself.\n\n\nShow the code\n\npriors_to_test = [\n    (\"Very Optimistic\", 15, 85),    # Believes 15% conversion rate\n    (\"Optimistic\", 12, 88),         # Believes 12% conversion rate  \n    (\"Historical Based\", 8, 92),    # Our original prior (8%)\n    ('Strong Historical', 80, 920),      # Mean = 0.08, ESS = 1000\n    (\"Skeptical\", 4, 96),           # Believes 4% conversion rate\n    (\"Uninformative\", 1, 1),        # Let data dominate completely\n]\n\nsensitivity_results = []\ntraces_to_comprare = []\n\nfor idx, (prior_name, alpha, beta) in enumerate(priors_to_test):\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        conversion_rate = pm.Beta(\"conversion_rate\", alpha=alpha, beta=beta)\n        obs = pm.Binomial(\"observations\", n=visitors, p=conversion_rate, observed=conversions)\n        trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, chains=4, random_seed=42, return_inferencedata=True, progressbar=False)\n        \n \n    posterior_samples = trace.posterior.stack(sample=(\"chain\", \"draw\"))\n    conversion_samples=posterior_samples['conversion_rate'].values\n    expected_uplift = conversion_samples.mean() - historical_baseline\n    expected_additional_conversions = monthly_visitors * expected_uplift\n    expected_monthly_value = expected_additional_conversions * conversion_value\n\n\n    posterior_mean = conversion_samples.mean()\n    posterior_std = conversion_samples.std()\n    prior_std = np.sqrt((alpha * beta) / ((alpha + beta)**2 * (alpha + beta + 1)))\n    prob_better = (conversion_samples &gt; historical_baseline).mean()\n    uncertainty_reduction = max(0, (prior_std - posterior_std) / prior_std)\n    \n    df = pd.DataFrame({\"Prior\": prior_name,\n                       \"Posterior\": conversion_samples}\n                       )\n    \n    sensitivity_results.append({\n        'Prior_Belief': prior_name,\n        'Prior_Parameters': f\"Beta({alpha}, {beta})\",\n        'Prior_Mean': f\"{alpha/(alpha+beta):.3f}\",\n        'Posterior_Mean': f\"{posterior_mean:.3f}\",\n        'Prob_Better': f\"{prob_better:.1%}\",\n        \"Expected_uplift\": f\"${expected_uplift:.1%}\",\n        \"Expected_monthly_value\": f\"${expected_monthly_value:,.0f}\",\n        'Uncertainty_Reduction': f\"{uncertainty_reduction:.1%}\",\n        'Data_Influence': 'Strong' if uncertainty_reduction &gt; 0.8 else 'Moderate'\n    })\n    traces_to_comprare.append(df) \nsensitivity_df = pd.DataFrame(sensitivity_results)\ntraces_to_comprare=pd.concat(traces_to_comprare)\nclear_output()\n\n\n\nLet first visualise the different priors\n\n\nShow the code\n\n\nchart = alt.Chart(traces_to_comprare).transform_density(density='Posterior', groupby=['Prior'], as_=['Posterior', 'density'])\\\n    .mark_line(opacity=0.5)\\\n    .encode(x='Posterior:Q', \n            y='density:Q', \n            color=alt.Color(\"Prior:N\").scale(domain=domain, range=colors[:len(domain)])\n            )\n\n\nreference_lines = alt.Chart(reference_data).mark_rule(\n    strokeDash=[5, 5], # Dashed line\n    size=1, \n).encode(\n    x='x:Q',\n    color=alt.Color('label:N', \n                    scale=alt.Scale(domain=reference_data['label'].tolist(), \n                                    range=reference_data['color'].tolist()),\n                    legend=alt.Legend(title=\"Conversion Rate\"))\n)\n\n\nfinal=chart + reference_lines \nfinal=final.properties(title='Posterior Distributions by Prior Belief', width=700, height=200).configure_axis(\n    # Set grid to False to remove all grid lines\n    grid=False\n).configure_view(\n    # Optional: Remove the surrounding border of the plot area\n    strokeWidth=0 \n)\nfinal.save('posterior_sensitivity.pdf')\nfinal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above show Posterior belief distributions under different prior assumptions.

All reasonable priors converge to the same conclusion: the new feature likely isn‚Äôt better than the old one.\nKey observations:\n\nPrior Pull: The data moderate extreme beliefs. The very optimistic prior (0.150) is pulled down to 0.100, while the skeptical prior (0.040) rises to 0.064‚Äîdemonstrating how new evidence shifts expectations toward a central value.\nPrior Strength vs.¬†Data Influence: The Strong Historical prior (Beta(80, 920)) and Uninformative prior (Beta(1, 1)) yield similar posteriors (~0.079, ~45% Prob_Better), but for opposite reasons. The former is dominated by prior belief; the latter, by data‚Äîshowing that strong evidence can overcome weak or missing priors.\nImpact on Decision Metrics:: The Very Optimistic prior suggests an 88% Prob_Better and +$9.9k expected value, favoring a launch. The Skeptical prior predicts only 12% Prob_Better and ‚Äì$8.2k, suggesting the opposite. Even moderate priors (e.g., 40‚Äì47%) could tip a go/no-go decision depending on the threshold.\n\n\n\n\nCommon Bayesian Pitfalls and Best Practices\nWhile Bayesian modeling provides a powerful framework for decision-making under uncertainty, several common mistakes can reduce its effectiveness. &gt; The first is overconfident priors, where excessively strong prior assumptions prevent new data from influencing the results. This issue is best mitigated by starting with weak or moderately informative priors and refining them as more evidence becomes available.\n\nA second pitfall is ignoring prior sensitivity. Conclusions may shift significantly depending on the chosen prior distribution, so it is essential to conduct sensitivity analyses using multiple plausible priors to ensure that insights are robust.\n\n\nThe third major issue involves misinterpreting probability. A statement such as ‚Äú95% probability‚Äù does not imply absolute certainty; rather, it reflects the degree of belief given the available data and assumptions. Probabilities in Bayesian analysis are best interpreted in terms of relative confidence, risk, and decision trade-offs.\n\nTo support rigorous implementation, the following checklist outlines a systematic workflow for Bayesian business analysis: 1. Define a clear decision or research question, 2. Collect relevant historical information to inform priors, 3. Select an appropriate likelihood function, 4. Test alternative prior specifications, 5. Run the model and verify diagnostics, 6. Interpret outcomes within the business or operational context, and communicate uncertainty transparently to stakeholders.\n\n\nNext Steps in the Bayesian Journey\nThis lesson introduced the foundations of Bayesian modeling as a framework for decision-making under uncertainty‚Äîan approach that integrates prior expertise with limited data to inform critical business and industrial decisions. The next stage is to translate these principles into practical applications.\nThe upcoming session will demonstrate how to apply the Bayesian framework to model time-to-failure for machines and customer retention durations. It will also explore methods for capturing patterns across naturally grouped data, such as regions, product lines, or customer segments.\n\n\nResources to Continue Learning:\n\nBayesian Methods for Hackers\nStatistical Rethinking\nDoing Bayesian Data Analysis\nBayesian Data Analysis\nPyMC Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nFaustine, Anthony. 2025. ‚ÄúUnderstanding Bayesian Thinking for\nIndustrial Applications.‚Äù October 10, 2025. https://sambaiga.github.io/blog/2025/10/bayesian-modelling-01.html."

    "text": "Abstract\nProbabilistic net-load forecasting in Low-Voltage (LV) distribution networks is essential in light of the increased variability introduced by the widespread integration of renewable energy sources (RES). Various probabilistic approaches based on neural networks have been proposed to solve this challenge. This study introduces lightweight neural network-based conformal prediction (Conformal-MLPF) for net-load forecasting within an LV power distribution network. It uses Split Conformal prediction to transform a lightweight MLP-based point forecast into a probabilistic forecast. Our validation on two real-life LV substations datasets suggests that the proposed Conformal-MLPF achieves a better tradeoff between forecasting performance and model complexity without requiring restrictive assumptions about data distribution."

    "text": "Abstract\nIndustrial loads offer challenges for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), such as phase imbalance associated with 3-phase lines. However, very little NILM research has been developed so far with this respect. This work presents a load recognition technique for NILM applying low complexity Fortesque Transform (FT). The FT decomposes the unbalanced 3-phase current waveform extracted from 3-phase aggregate power measurements to balance the given load. The 3-phases current waveform is transformed into an image-like representation using a compressedeuclidean distance matrix to improve the recognition ability further. The image representation is used as input to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to learn the patterns of labeled data. Experimental evaluation of the industrial aggregated dataset shows that FT improves recognition performance by 5.8%, compared to the case without FT."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPower demand forecasting is becoming a crucial tool for the planning and operation of Low Voltage (LV) distribution systems. Most importantly, the high penetration of Photovoltaics (PV) power generation as part of Distributed Energy Resource (DER)s has transformed the power demand forecasting problem at the distribution level into net-load forecasting. This paper introduces a novel and scalable approach to probabilistic forecasting at LV substation with PV generation. It presents a multi-variates probabilistic forecasting approach, leveraging Quantile Regression (QR). The proposed architecture uses a computationally efficient feed-forward neural net to capture the complex interaction between the historical load demands and covariate variables such as solar irradiance. It is empirically demonstrated that the proposed method can efficiently produce well-calibrated forecasts, both auto-regressively or in a single forward pass. Furthermore, a benchmark against four state-of-the-art forecasting approaches shows that the proposed approach offers a desirable trade-off between forecasting accuracies, calibrated uncertainty, and computation complexity."

    "text": "The Heart of the Matter: Target the Group, Not the Individual\nAt the core of Kurt Lewin‚Äôs work is a groundbreaking argument: meaningful change doesn‚Äôt happen at the individual level, but at the group level. According to Lewin, group behaviour is shaped by field of forces and symbolic interactions that dictate the group‚Äôs structure and, in turn, modify individual behaviour (Burnes 2007).\nWhy is the group the primary focus? Because an individual, even one who is open to change, is constantly under immense group pressure to conform to existing norms. These group routines and patterns aren‚Äôt just passive habits; they are actively valued and enforced by the group to maintain stability (Burnes 2007). This aligns with modern findings, such as Kotter‚Äôs, that resistance is more likely to arise from the system and its ingrained norms than from isolated individuals (Al-Haddad and Kotnour 2015). Therefore, any effective change strategy must concentrate on influencing the team‚Äôs collective norms, roles, and values ."

    "text": "The Prerequisite: Creating a ‚ÄòFelt Need‚Äô for Change\nBefore any change can begin, a critical prerequisite must be met: there must be a felt need. This is the deep, internal realisation both at the individual and group levels‚Äîthat the current way of doing things is no longer sufficient and that change is necessary (Burnes 2004, 2007).\nIf the collective felt-need within a group or organisation is low, introducing change becomes problematic. You cannot impose transformation on a group that does not perceive a problem. Lewin argued that successful change begins with engaging group members, helping them understand the why behind the change, and fostering a shared commitment to move forward.\nThis ‚Äúfelt need‚Äù is not merely emotional; it represents a psychological unfreezing of the group‚Äôs current norms and equilibrium. Without this shared readiness, even the best-designed change initiatives are likely to fail."

    "text": "The Method: Action Research and Collaborative Change\nUnderstanding group behaviour is one thing; changing it is another. Lewin‚Äôs framework is not just theoretical it is profoundly practical. He proposed a participative method known as Action Research, a cyclical process for diagnosing and addressing organisational challenges (Burnes 2004, 2007).\nAction Research emphasises that effective change is achieved with people, not to people. It involves a series of iterative steps that make the change process collaborative and adaptive:\n\nAnalyze the situation: The group collaboratively diagnoses the problem, identifying underlying issues that influence behaviour.\nIdentify alternatives: Members discuss and explore all possible solutions.\nChoose and act: The group selects and implements the most appropriate solution.\nReflect and repeat: Results are evaluated, and the process is refined based on collective learning.\n\nThis method reflects Lewin‚Äôs belief that behaviour can only be understood and modified within a group context. It embodies the principle of self-management, where groups play an active role in shaping their own behaviour (Burnes 2004). Change, therefore, becomes a participative and collaborative process one that transforms resistance into ownership."

    "text": "The Framework: Lewin‚Äôs 3-Step Model for Group Transformation\nWith the group engaged and a collaborative process in motion, Lewin proposed that organisational change unfolds through his well-known 3-Step Model (Burnes 2004):\n\nUnfreeze: This stage creates the felt need for change by disrupting existing norms, routines, and assumptions. It prepares the group to let go of old patterns and accept that change is necessary.\nChange (Move): Guided by the principles of Action Research, the group develops and adopts new behaviours, attitudes, and values. This is the implementation phase, where learning and experimentation take place.\nRefreeze: The final stage solidifies the new equilibrium. New group norms are embedded in organisational culture and supported by systems and shared values, ensuring the change endures.\n\nLewin believed that because individuals are inherently influenced by group norms and social forces, sustainable transformation must occur at the group level, not solely at the level of individual behaviour (Al-Haddad and Kotnour 2015). As he noted, group routines and patterns have intrinsic value they are not merely the product of opposing forces but also serve a positive function in maintaining group identity and cohesion (Burnes 2004, 2007)."

In an age of constant disruption and agile methodologies, achieving a stable equilibrium may seem unrealistic.\nContemporary perspectives suggest that organisations should cultivate a culture of continuous learning and adaptability a state of being ‚Äúpermanently unfrozen.‚Äù Nevertheless, Lewin‚Äôs insight into the power of group dynamics remains timeless. Whether or not we ‚Äúrefreeze,‚Äù successful change still depends on engaging the collective forces that shape how people think, feel, and act together."

Your next change initiative will succeed or fail based on your ability to look past individual behaviours and see the powerful, invisible currents of group norms, pressures, and values. To change the individual, you must first have the courage to engage, understand, and transform the group."

The book serves as both a wake-up call and a roadmap for individuals like me overwhelmed by competing demands and distractions. McKeown emphasizes the transformative power of less but better encouraging readers to focus on their highest point of contribution.\nKey Lesson: Clarity about priorities opens the door to greater freedom and fulfillment. Life is filled with trade-offs, and the path to true success lies in making intentional, wise choices that align with what truly matters.\nBy systematically eliminating non-essential tasks and distractions, McKeown guides readers in protecting their most valuable resources‚Äîtime, energy, attention, and well-being. This essentialist mindset empowers individuals to make intentional choices and concentrate on activities that genuinely enhance their lives, leading to greater fulfillment and success. I find this approach liberating, as it encourages me to focus on what brings the most value rather than getting caught up in the noise of everyday life.\nThe book also highlights the importance of saying no to non essential commitments, which can be challenging but ultimately leads to a more fulfilling and productive life. Embracing this mindset has inspired me to evaluate my commitments and ensure they align with my core values and long-term goals.\n\n\nThe Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz\nThe Magic of Thinking Big  by David J. Schwartz is a timeless reminder that success isn‚Äôt solely reserved for the most gifted. It‚Äôs a testament to the power of mindset. Those who dare to dream big, believe in themselves, and take intentional action are most likely to achieve their goals. This book profoundly impacted my thinking, project me to expand my mindset, overcome limiting beliefs, and cultivate habits that align with my aspirations for greatness.\nFurthermore, the book emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect, learning from setbacks, and embracing continuous learning as essential for a successful and fulfilling life. This resonates with me, as it highlights that growth often comes from our experiences, both positive and negative.\nKey lessons: Success is primarily a product of mindset ‚Äì believing in yourself, cultivating a positive attitude, and taking consistent action towards your goals, regardless of inherent talent or luck.\n\n\nSame As Ever by Morgan Housel\nMorgan Housel‚Äôs Same As Ever  provides a compelling framework for understanding the enduring nature of human behavior. Despite the rapid pace of change in our world, Housel argues that our core emotions, desires, and behaviors remain remarkably consistent.\nHousel emphasizes the concept of rational optimism, which involves recognizing both the potential for growth and the inevitability of challenges. This balanced perspective encourages us to adhere to core principles like integrity and patience while also acknowledging the inherent strengths and weaknesses of human nature. I find this approach refreshing, as it promotes a realistic yet hopeful outlook on life.\nThe book explores how fundamental human emotions‚Äîsuch as fear, greed, and hope continue to drive our actions, regardless of the technological and social changes surrounding us. This idea serves as a reminder that while the world may evolve, the essence of what it means to be human remains constant. Housel‚Äôs insights encourage us to focus on these timeless aspects of human behavior, which can guide our decisions and interactions in an ever-changing landscape.\nBy embracing the enduring truths of human nature, we can navigate the complexities of modern life with greater wisdom and resilience. I appreciate Housel‚Äôs ability to distill these insights into practical guidance, making this book a valuable resource for anyone seeking to foster a balanced and optimistic approach to life.\nKey lesson understanding the enduring nature of human behavior, while embracing rational optimism and core principles is essential for navigating life‚Äôs complexities and fostering meaningful relationships.\n\n\nNever Split the Difference by Chris Voss\nNever Split the Difference  by Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, offers unique insights into the art of negotiation that have completely shifted my perspective on the subject. This book illustrates how powerful negotiation can be, not just in high-stakes situations but also in everyday life.\nVoss challenges traditional negotiation strategies that often focus on compromise. Instead, he advocates for empathy, understanding, and subtle psychological tactics to achieve optimal outcomes. This approach has taught me that negotiation is less about winning and more about fostering collaboration and curiosity. By prioritizing these elements, I can engage in conversations that lead to more meaningful and productive results.\nThe book provides practical tools that I can apply in various contexts, whether in professional settings or personal interactions. Voss emphasizes the importance of active listening and emotional intelligence, which are crucial for understanding the needs and motivations of others. This has encouraged me to approach negotiations with a mindset of collaboration rather than confrontation, ultimately leading to better relationships and outcomes.\nThrough engaging anecdotes and real-life examples, Voss illustrates how these techniques can be effectively implemented. His insights have inspired me to rethink my approach to discussions and negotiations, making me more aware of the dynamics at play.\nKey Lesson: True influence comes from understanding others, not overpowering them.\n\n\nThink Again by Adam Grant\nIn Think Again,  Adam Grant profoundly challenges our assumptions about knowledge and belief, urging readers to cultivate a mindset of intellectual humility and curiosity. He defines intellectual humility as recognizing the limitations of our own knowledge and being willing to learn from everyone. This approach fosters open inquiry and leads to better decision-making, which I find incredibly valuable in both personal and professional contexts.\nGrant encourages us to approach life with curiosity and openness, advocating for the importance of questioning our beliefs, considering new evidence, testing our assumptions, and holding our ideas loosely. This flexibility allows us to adapt when presented with new information. I particularly resonate with his assertion that being wrong is not a failure; rather, it is an opportunity for learning. When we discover we‚Äôre mistaken, we are simply becoming less wrong‚Äîa positive step in personal growth.\nFurthermore, Grant highlights the significance of separating our identity from our ideas. This separation enables more objective evaluation and reduces defensive reactions when our beliefs are challenged. He introduces the concept of a challenge network a group of trusted individuals who provide honest feedback and help us reconsider our perspectives. This idea has inspired me to seek out such a network in my own life, as it can foster deeper understanding and growth.\nGrant‚Äôs approach to learning and growth resonates deeply with me, as it emphasizes not merely changing one‚Äôs mind but creating a life where learning and evolving take precedence over the need to always be right. This shift in perspective is crucial for personal growth, fostering innovation, and cultivating meaningful relationships.\nOverall, Think Again serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of intellectual humility and the continuous journey of self-improvement. I look forward to applying these principles as I navigate my own beliefs and interactions with others.\nKey Lesson: Growth comes from being willing to admit what you don‚Äôt know and learning from others.\n\n\nMan‚Äôs Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl\nThis profound memoir and philosophical exploration  by Viktor Frankl delves into the human capacity to find meaning and purpose even in the face of unimaginable suffering. Drawing upon his own harrowing experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps, Frankl presents a compelling argument for the human will to survive and the enduring power of the human spirit. His reflections on resilience and purpose have encouraged me to view suffering as an opportunity for growth.\nFrankl‚Äôs central thesis is that life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones. He asserts that our main drive is not pleasure, as Freud suggested, but rather the pursuit of meaning. This will to meaning serves as a fundamental motivation for human behavior, which resonates deeply with me. It has shifted my perspective on challenges, prompting me to seek out the lessons and insights that can emerge from difficult experiences.\nThroughout the book, Frankl shares personal anecdotes and observations that illustrate how individuals can choose their attitudes and responses, even in the direst situations. This idea of choosing one‚Äôs response is a powerful reminder of our inherent strength and agency, reinforcing the notion that we can find purpose in our suffering.\nMoreover, Frankl emphasizes the importance of having a clear sense of purpose, which can guide us through life‚Äôs adversities. His insights have inspired me to reflect on my own values and aspirations, encouraging me to cultivate a mindset that prioritizes meaning and fulfillment over mere pleasure or comfort.\nOverall, Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning is a transformative read that offers profound insights into the human experience. Frankl‚Äôs ability to articulate the significance of meaning in our lives has not only enriched my understanding of resilience but also motivated me to embrace challenges as opportunities for personal growth and deeper understanding.\nKey Lesson: When you have a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù to live, you can bear almost any ‚Äúhow.‚Äù This powerful insight underscores the importance of having a strong sense of purpose, which can provide the strength needed to endure the most challenging circumstances.\n\n\nThe Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt\nIn The Anxious Generation , Jonathan Haidt presents a deeply researched and thought-provoking examination of the alarming rise in anxiety and depression among young people, particularly Generation Z. His compelling evidence indicates a significant increase in mood disorders among adolescents since the early 2010s, which he links to the widespread adoption of smartphones and social media.\nHaidt identifies several key factors contributing to this mental health crisis. First, he discusses excessive social media use, citing studies that reveal a correlation between heavy usage, around 3 to 4 hours daily and increased levels of depression and anxiety, especially among girls. This insight has made me reflect on how pervasive social media is in the lives of young people today and the potential consequences it carries.\nAnother critical aspect of Haidt‚Äôs argument is his critique of overprotective parenting. He highlights the cultural shift towards safetyism which he believes deprives children of essential experiences needed to develop resilience and problem-solving skills. This perspective challenges me to consider how our parenting practices may inadvertently hinder the growth of independence and confidence in young people.\nHaidt also contrasts the current phone based childhood with the previous play based childhood, arguing that this transition has disrupted children‚Äôs social interactions and neurological development. This comparison resonates with me, as it underscores the importance of unstructured play and face-to-face interactions in fostering healthy development.\nOverall, The Anxious Generation serves as a crucial resource for understanding the mental health challenges facing today‚Äôs youth. Haidt‚Äôs analysis not only sheds light on the factors contributing to this crisis but also calls for a reevaluation of how we approach parenting and societal expectations in order to foster a healthier, more resilient generation. His exploration of these issues has prompted me to think critically about how we can better support young people in navigating the complexities of modern life.\nKey Lesson: Overemphasis on safety and protection can hinder young people‚Äôs resilience and ability to cope with adversity, ultimately making them less prepared to face life‚Äôs challenges.\n\n\nThe Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel\nThis book  reshaped the way I think about money, wealth, and financial freedom. Unlike traditional personal finance books that focus on numbers, budgets, or technical strategies, Housel takes a deeply human approach, exploring how our emotions, habits, and perspectives shape our financial decisions.\nHousel‚Äôs insights helped me understand that money isn‚Äôt just about math, it‚Äôs about behavior. The way we think about money is influenced by our upbringing, life experiences, and psychological biases, which often leads to decisions that don‚Äôt align with logic or long-term goals. This perspective has encouraged me to reflect on my own financial habits and the underlying motivations behind them.\nOne of the key takeaways from the book is that the biggest value of money isn‚Äôt to buy luxury goods but to gain control over your time and life the ultimate form of freedom. This idea has profoundly impacted my view of financial success, shifting my focus from accumulating wealth for its own sake to using it as a tool for achieving a more fulfilling and independent life.\nHousel also shares engaging stories that illustrate the strange ways people think about money, making complex concepts accessible and relatable. His emphasis on the importance of patience and long-term thinking has inspired me to adopt a more measured approach to my financial decisions, recognizing that true wealth often comes from consistent, thoughtful actions over time.\nKey lesson: Money is not about what you earn or spend‚Äîit‚Äôs about the freedom to live life on your terms. true wealth isn‚Äôt about flashy cars, expensive vacations, or big houses‚Äîit‚Äôs about what you don‚Äôt see: financial freedom, security, and the ability to make choices without stress.\n\n\nThe Forty Rules of Love by Elif Shafak\nElif Shafak‚Äôs  The Forty Rules of Love beautifully intertwines themes of love, spirituality, and self-discovery. Through the parallel stories of Ella Rubenstein, a contemporary housewife, and the profound spiritual connection between Rumi and Shams of Tabriz, the novel explores the transformative power of love in its various forms; divine, romantic, and platonic.\nShafak emphasizes that true love requires vulnerability, embracing imperfection, and a willingness to let go of control. This perspective has profoundly impacted my understanding of relationships, highlighting that love is not just about connection but also about personal growth and acceptance.\nThe journey of love, as depicted in the novel, is deeply intertwined with spirituality, suggesting that it is a path of surrender, trust, and faith. Furthermore, the novel acknowledges the duality of pain and joy inherent in love, recognizing that pain can be a catalyst for growth and transformation. This insight has encouraged me to embrace the complexities of my own experiences, understanding that challenges can lead to deeper connections and greater self-awareness.\nUltimately, The Forty Rules of Love celebrates the power of stories to heal, connect, and inspire us to live authentically. Shafak‚Äôs narrative encourages readers to embrace their unique paths and find meaning in the human experience. The book has inspired me to reflect on my own relationships and the ways in which love can shape our lives, urging me to approach love with an open heart and a willingness to learn.\nKey Lesson: Love, in all its forms, is a journey of transformation that requires vulnerability and courage.\n\n\nThe Man in the Mirror by Patrick Morley\nThe 25th Anniversary Edition of The Man in the Mirror  by Patrick Morley is a timeless guide that continues to resonate with men seeking purpose and integrity. Even decades later, Morley‚Äôs wisdom remains remarkably relevant, as he has updated the content with fresh insights to address the unique challenges of today‚Äôs world.\nThrough its exploration of 24 key challenges, Morley provides a practical, faith-based framework for navigating issues such as career pressures, spiritual emptiness, broken relationships, and misplaced priorities. This approach has prompted me to reflect on my own life and the various obstacles I face.\nOne of the most powerful messages in The Man in the Mirror is that true success is not about what you achieve, but who you become and how you serve others. This perspective has shifted my understanding of success, urging me to confront my values, goals, and character. Morley also highlights the distractions of modern life, including technology and shifting cultural values, which can easily divert our focus from what truly matters.\nAdditionally, the book encourages men to consider their legacy. Morley emphasizes the importance of leaving a positive impact through service, love, and faith, compelling me to think about how my actions today will resonate in the future.\nOverall, The Man in the Mirror serves as an invaluable resource for any man seeking to cultivate a meaningful life rooted in integrity and purpose. I appreciate the insights Morley offers, and I look forward to applying these principles as I strive to make a lasting, positive difference in my own life and the lives of others.\n\n\nThe 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership by John Maxwell\nReading John C. Maxwell‚Äôs  The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership has been one of the most practical and insightful experiences of my year. This timeless guide is incredibly applicable for anyone looking to enhance their leadership skills, whether in the workplace, community, or personal life, as it distills decades of experience into 21 core principles.\nWhat resonated with me the most is Maxwell‚Äôs emphasis that true leadership is about influence, not authority. He highlights the importance of creating genuine connections and inspiring others to follow, which I believe is crucial in any leadership role. A significant aspect of his approach is the concept of servant leadership, which prioritizes the needs of the team. By acknowledging their importance, supporting individual growth, and fostering an empowering environment, leaders can cultivate a more engaged and motivated team.\nMaxwell also stresses that trust is the cornerstone of effective leadership. He argues that trust is built on personal character, consistent values, honesty, and the courage to apologize and make amends when necessary. This insight has made me reflect on my own leadership practices and the importance of being trustworthy in all my interactions.\nFurthermore, I appreciate Maxwell‚Äôs perspective that leadership is a continuous journey of personal development. His assertion that we must commit to lifelong learning and adaptation is a reminder that there is always room for growth, no matter how experienced we may become.\nFinally, Maxwell encourages leaders to focus on their long-term impact. This includes developing other leaders, creating lasting positive change, and leading with authenticity and ethical principles. This holistic approach to leadership inspires me to think beyond immediate results and consider how my actions can contribute to a positive legacy.\nKey lesson: Leadership is not about titles‚Äîit‚Äôs about service and influence.\n\n\nDigital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport\nIn our hyper-connected world, overflowing with notifications and constant digital distractions, Cal Newport‚Äôs Digital Minimalism offers a refreshing perspective. Rather than demonizing technology, Newport encourages us to cultivate a more intentional relationship with it. This approach has prompted me to rethink how I interact with digital tools in my daily life.\nNewport challenges us to critically examine our technology usage, prioritizing tools that align with our values and eliminating those that detract from our well-being. This idea resonates deeply with me, as it highlights the importance of being mindful about the technology we choose to engage with. His insights have inspired me to assess the impact of various digital platforms on my life, leading to a more discerning approach to my screen time.\nThe book provides practical strategies for implementing a digital minimalist lifestyle, such as engaging in digital decluttering and establishing technology-free time. These strategies have encouraged me to set boundaries around my usage, helping me reclaim time for more meaningful activities and connections.\nMoreover, Newport emphasizes the significance of real-world interactions and the value of focusing on activities that truly enrich our lives. This perspective has motivated me to seek out experiences that foster deeper connections with others and align more closely with my personal values.\nNewport‚Äôs emphasis on intentionality has not only reshaped my view of digital tools but also empowered me to take control of my digital habits, fostering a healthier and more fulfilling relationship with technology.\nKey lesson: technology should serve us, not the other way around. By intentionally choosing how we engage with technology and setting clear boundaries, we can reclaim our time, focus, and ultimately, our sense of purpose."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nThis year‚Äôs reading journey has been a transformative experience, filled with diverse perspectives that weave together a powerful narrative about living a meaningful life. Each book offered unique insights, prompting me to re-evaluate my priorities, cultivate resilience, and embrace the power of love in all its forms.\nKey themes emerged throughout my reading, particularly the importance of purpose and intentionality. Books like Build by Tony Fadell and Essentialism by Greg McKeown emphasized the significance of starting with ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and focusing on what truly matters. Fadell‚Äôs exploration of product development highlighted the necessity of identifying and solving the right problems, while McKeown‚Äôs mantra of less but better encouraged me to prioritize ruthlessly and protect my most valuable resources. Digital Minimalism further reinforced the need for intentional living in our digital age.\nSeveral books this year profoundly influenced my thinking, particularly those that emphasized the transformative power of mindset. The Magic of Thinking Big by David J. Schwartz inspired me to believe in myself and embrace a growth mindset, while Think Again by Adam Grant challenged my assumptions and encouraged me to embrace the discomfort of uncertainty. Grant convincingly argues that being wrong isn‚Äôt a failure, but rather an opportunity for learning. When we discover our initial beliefs are incorrect, we‚Äôre simply becoming less wrong, a crucial step in personal growth. He emphasizes the importance of intellectual humility, acknowledging the limitations of our own knowledge and being open to learning from diverse perspectives. This approach fosters open inquiry and leads to better decisionmaking. Both books highlighted the importance of continuous learning and adaptation as essential for personal and professional growth\nResilience emerged as another key theme. Same As Ever by Morgan Housel offered valuable insights into the enduring nature of human behavior, reminding me that while the world changes, core human principles remain constant. The Psychology of Money further emphasized the importance of understanding our emotions and biases in navigating life‚Äôs challenges. Jonathan Haidt‚Äôs The Anxious Generation highlighted the necessity of fostering resilience, independence, and critical thinking in today‚Äôs world. This message resonated deeply with Viktor Frankl‚Äôs Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning, which serves as a powerful testament to the human spirit‚Äôs ability to find meaning and purpose even in the face of unimaginable suffering.\nThe importance of human connection was evident throughout my reading. Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss emphasized the power of empathy and understanding in communication, while The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership by John C. Maxwell highlighted the significance of service and influence in building meaningful relationships.\nFinally, Elif Shafak‚Äôs The Forty Rules of Love beautifully explored the transformative power of love in all its forms, reminding me that love requires vulnerability, courage, and a willingness to embrace imperfection.\nThese books have left a lasting impression, shaping how I think, act, and relate to others. They have reminded me to focus on building a life of purpose, cultivating resilience, and embracing the power of human connection."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques are increasingly becoming a key instrument for identifying the power consumption of individual appliances based on a single metering point. Particularly, deep learning (DL) models are gaining interest in this regard. However, the challenges brought by the NILM datasets and the nonavailability of common experimental guidelines tend to compromise comparison, research transparency, and replicability. The limited adoption of efficient research instruments and lack of best practices guidelines contribute in huge part to this problem, where no features, encouraging standardized formats for benchmarking, and results sharing are offered. To address these issues, we first present a brief overview of recent best practices for DL and highlight how deep NILM research can benefit from these practices. Furthermore, we suggest a novel open-source toolkit leveraging these practices, i.e., Deep-NILMTK. The proposed toolkit offers a common testing bed for NILM algorithms independently of the underlying deep learning framework with a modular NILM pipeline that can easily be customized. Furthermore, Deep-NILMTK introduces the concept of experiment templating to offer predesigned experiments allowing to enhancing research efficiency. Leveraging this concept and DL best practices, we present a case study of creating an online NILM benchmark repository1 considering eight of the most popular deep NILM algorithms. All sources relative to the tool are made publicly available on Github2 along with the corresponding documentation."

    "text": "Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques are increasingly becoming a key instrument for identifying the power consumption of individual appliances based on a single metering point. Particularly, deep learning (DL) models are gaining interest in this regard. However, the challenges brought by the NILM datasets and the nonavailability of common experimental guidelines tend to compromise comparison, research transparency, and replicability. The limited adoption of efficient research instruments and lack of best practices guidelines contribute in huge part to this problem, where no features, encouraging standardized formats for benchmarking, and results sharing are offered. To address these issues, we first present a brief overview of recent best practices for DL and highlight how deep NILM research can benefit from these practices. Furthermore, we suggest a novel open-source toolkit leveraging these practices, i.e., Deep-NILMTK. The proposed toolkit offers a common testing bed for NILM algorithms independently of the underlying deep learning framework with a modular NILM pipeline that can easily be customized. Furthermore, Deep-NILMTK introduces the concept of experiment templating to offer predesigned experiments allowing to enhancing research efficiency. Leveraging this concept and DL best practices, we present a case study of creating an online NILM benchmark repository1 considering eight of the most popular deep NILM algorithms. All sources relative to the tool are made publicly available on Github2 along with the corresponding documentation."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPower demand forecasting is becoming a crucial tool for the planning and operation of Low Voltage (LV) distribution systems. Most importantly, the high penetration of Photovoltaics (PV) power generation as part of Distributed Energy Resource (DER)s has transformed the power demand forecasting problem at the distribution level into net-load forecasting. This paper introduces a novel and scalable approach to probabilistic forecasting at LV substation with PV generation. It presents a multi-variates probabilistic forecasting approach, leveraging Quantile Regression (QR). The proposed architecture uses a computationally efficient feed-forward neural net to capture the complex interaction between the historical load demands and covariate variables such as solar irradiance. It is empirically demonstrated that the proposed method can efficiently produce well-calibrated forecasts, both auto-regressively or in a single forward pass. Furthermore, a benchmark against four state-of-the-art forecasting approaches shows that the proposed approach offers a desirable trade-off between forecasting accuracies, calibrated uncertainty, and computation complexity."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe key advantage of smart meters over traditional metering devices is their ability to transfer consumption information to remote data processing systems. Besides enabling the automated collection of a customer‚Äôs electricity consumption for billing purposes, the data collected by these devices makes the realization of many novel use cases possible. However, the large majority of such services are tailored to improve the power grid‚Äôs operation as a whole. For example, forecasts of household energy consumption or photovoltaic production allow for improved power plant generation scheduling. Similarly, the detection of anomalous consumption patterns can indicate electricity theft and serve as a trigger for corresponding investigations. Even though customers can directly influence their electrical energy consumption, the range of use cases to the users‚Äô benefit remains much smaller than those that benefit the grid in general. In this work, we thus review the range of services tailored to the needs of end-customers. By briefly discussing their technological foundations and their potential impact on future developments, we highlight the great potentials of utilizing smart meter data from a user-centric perspective. Several open research challenges in this domain, arising from the shortcomings of state-of-the-art data communication and processing methods, are furthermore given. We expect their investigation to lead to significant advancements in data processing services and ultimately raise the customer experience of operating smart meters."

However, very little NILM research has been developed so far with this respect. This work presents a load recognition technique for NILM applying low complexity Fortesque Transform (FT). The FT decomposes the unbalanced 3-phase current waveform extracted from 3-phase aggregate power measurements to balance the given load. The 3-phases current waveform is transformed into an image-like representation using a compressedeuclidean distance matrix to improve the recognition ability further. The image representation is used as input to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to learn the patterns of labeled data. Experimental evaluation of the industrial aggregated dataset shows that FT improves recognition performance by 5.8%, compared to the case without FT."
