    "### Choosing the Beta Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The capacity data being modeled, $C$, represents the battery's health and is strictly bounded between zero and its initial (maximum) capacity, $C_{\\text{max}}$. The goal of this analysis is to model the evolution of $C$. In many standard regression approaches, the model's likelihood function (which defines the distribution of the noise) is assumed to be Gaussian (Normal). This assumption is fundamentally incompatible with the physical reality of capacity degradation for two key reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Gaussian models assume the target variable can take any real value ($-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$), ignoring the fact that the underlying capacity $C$  cannot fall outside their physical limits (i.e., $[C_{\\text{min}}, C_{\\text{max}}]$ )\n",
    "2.  With enough extrapolation, Gaussian models produce impossible values (e.g.,negative capacity). In safety-critical systems, such predictions are dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beta distribution is consequently chosen as the likelihood function for this regression problem. The Beta distribution is flexible, capable of modeling various shapes (uniform, U-shaped, skewed) depending on its shape parameters ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$).Furthermore, since battery capacity degradation is continuous and strictly bounded by $[C_{\\text{min}}, C_{\\text{max}}]$, a Beta likelihood provides a natural modeling choice that avoids the ad-hoc truncation required by Gaussian assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fit the Beta's intrinsic $[0, 1]$ domain, capacity ($C_i$) is first scaled into a normalized State of Health ($\\tilde{C}_i$) using the following transformation:$$\\tilde{C}_i = \\frac{C_i - C_{\\text{min}}}{C_{\\text{max}} - C_{\\text{min}}}$$The model then utilizes the Beta distribution for the scaled capacity:$$\\tilde{C}_i \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i)$$where $\\alpha_i, \\beta_i > 0$ and $\\tilde{C}_i \\in [0, 1]$. This modeling choice ensures all predicted $\\tilde{C}_i$ values remain physically plausible while allowing for flexible modeling of degradation patterns through the shape parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this work, the non-linear decay component is modeled as an exponential function: $$f(k_i) = -A\\cdot(1-e^{-\\lambda \\cdot k_i})$$ where $k_i$ is the cycle count, $\\lambda$ is the degradation rate, and $A>0$ is a learnable amplitude parameter controlling the strength of decay. This captures the physical reality that battery capacity degrades rapidly at first and then more slowly over time. where:\n",

    "2. Degradation Term ($e^{-\\lambda \\cdot k_i}$): This is the non-linear exponential decay over the cycle count $k_i$, controlled by the rate $\\lambda$. This term ensures the capacity prediction naturally trends downward toward zero capacity over time.\n",
    "3. Operational Effects ($\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$): This is a standard linear combination, where $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the vector of coefficients for the standardized operational features $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$. \n",

    "This models how factors like maximum temperature accelerate or slow down the degradation.\n",

    "> 🧠 **Self-Test**: You are modeling $\\text{SoH}$, which must stay in $[0, 1]$. Your linear predictor, $\\eta_i = \\beta_0 + \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, can produce values ranging from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.What would happen if you skipped the Logit Link Function and simply set $\\mu_i = \\eta_i$?

The model learns the degradation rate ($\\lambda$) and operational sensitivities ($\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$) exclusively from this unit’s historical data. All remaining batteries of the same chemistry are assigned to the test set (test_df).

    "Point-prediction accuracy is evaluated using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Together, these metrics assess how well the model’s posterior predictive mean captures the observed capacity degradation trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $R^2$ quantifies the proportion of variance in the observed capacity explained by the model. Values close to 1 indicate that the predicted degradation curve accurately follows the overall trend and slope of capacity fade.\n",

    "- MAE represents the average absolute deviation between predicted and observed capacity values, expressed in State-of-Health (SoH) units. MAE provides a physically interpretable measure of typical prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RMSE penalizes larger deviations more strongly than MAE and is therefore particularly sensitive to localized mismatches, especially during the highly nonlinear end-of-life degradation phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results summarized above, the model achieves $R^2$ values between $0.910$ and $1.0$, with MAE in the range of $0.010$–$0.040$ SoH units, indicating strong point-prediction accuracy across all evaluated cells. RMSE values range from $0.01$ to $0.05$ SoH units, confirming that large deviations are generally rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Cell 34 exhibits the highest RMSE ($0.05$), along with comparatively lower $R^2$ and higher MAE than the remaining cells. This combination indicates that, while the model captures the overall degradation trend for Cell 34, it experiences larger localized errors—particularly near late-life degradation relative to other cells. These deviations suggest the presence of sharper nonlinear behavior or cell-specific degradation mechanisms not fully represented by the global model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uncertainty Quality Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond point accuracy, a central goal of Bayesian modeling is to provide reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates. This is assessed using Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Normalized Mean Prediction Interval (NMPI).\n",

    "\n",
    "- NMPI quantifies the average width of the predictive interval, normalized by the observed capacity range. NMPI reflects the sharpness of predictions: lower values indicate tighter uncertainty bounds, which are essential for actionable maintenance and risk-based decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results show consistently low NMPI values (approximately $\\mathbf{0.1}$) across all test cells. This confirms that the predictive intervals are narrow relative to the capacity range, indicating high confidence in the model’s predictions. At the same time, PICP exceeds $0.90$ for most cells, demonstrating that this confidence is not over-stated and that the uncertainty bounds are well calibrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell 34 again deviates from this pattern, exhibiting reduced PICP ($75\\%$).

    "This post demonstrates that a single-level Bayesian Beta regression model, informed by physics-aware priors and carefully engineered features, can deliver highly accurate capacity predictions together with trustworthy uncertainty bounds. The model achieves near-perfect predictive accuracy while maintaining well-calibrated $95%$ credible intervals, validating the use of Beta likelihoods and informed priors for battery degradation modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the current formulation assumes that the degradation rate ($\\lambda_{\\text{rate}}$) and operational sensitivities ($\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$) are shared across the entire battery fleet. In practice, manufacturing variability and latent defects introduce unit-specific degradation behavior. As a result, even a highly accurate global model may underpredict risk for batteries from unfavorable batches or overestimate degradation for higher-quality units.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coming Next**:  In Part 3, this limitation will be addressed by introducing Hierarchical Bayesian Models. These models learn a robust global degradation trend while allowing each individual battery to exhibit informed local deviations in parameters such as $\\lambda_{\\text{rate}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.
