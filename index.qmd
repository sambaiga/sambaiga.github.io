I am a Lead Data Scientist at the Centre for Intelligent Power (CIP) at [Eaton](https://www.eaton.com/ie/en-gb/company/careers/life-at-eaton/dublin.html) in Dublin, Ireland. In my role, I lead the development of data analytics and machine learning powered products and services that contribute to intelligent power systems. 

Before joining CIP Eaton, I served as a Senior Industrial Analytics Researcher in [Irish Manufacturing Research (IMR)](https://imr.ie/), Dublin, Ireland. There, I developed and executed data analytics and AI-based solutions to empower manufacturers located in Ireland to embrace and lead the Industrial 4.0 revolution as early adopters and frontrunners. Prior to that, I worked as a Data Scientist and ML Researcher at [CeADAR](https://www.ceadar.ie/), a research center affiliated with University College Dublin, Ireland. I also served as a Machine Learning Researcher at [IDLab, Imec](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en) at the University of Ghent, Belgium.
