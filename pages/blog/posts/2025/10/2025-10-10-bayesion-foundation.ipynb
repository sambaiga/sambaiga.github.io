    "> The first is overconfident priors, where excessively strong prior assumptions prevent new data from influencing the results. This issue is best mitigated by starting with weak or moderately informative priors and refining them as more evidence becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A second pitfall is ignoring prior sensitivity. Conclusions may shift significantly depending on the chosen prior distribution, so it is essential to conduct sensitivity analyses using multiple plausible priors to ensure that insights are robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The third major issue involves misinterpreting probability. A statement such as “95% probability” does not imply absolute certainty; rather, it reflects the degree of belief given the available data and assumptions. Probabilities in Bayesian analysis are best interpreted in terms of relative confidence, risk, and decision trade-offs."
