  This paper presents a probabilistic forecasting approach tailored for low voltage (LV) 
  substations, offering short-term predictions for three crucial variables: voltage, 
  reactive power, and active power. These parameters play a vital role in the resilience 
  of distribution systems, especially in the presence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).
