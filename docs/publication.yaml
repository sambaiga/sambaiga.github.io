## Paper Details

**Conference:** CIRED Chicago Workshop 2024: Resilience of Electric Distribution Systems  
**Location:** Chicago, USA  
**Date:** 2025  
**Pages:** 27-31  
**DOI:** [10.1049/icp.2024.2555](https://doi.org/10.1049/icp.2024.2555)

## Abstract

This paper presents a probabilistic forecasting approach tailored for low voltage (LV) 
substations, offering short-term predictions for three crucial variables: voltage, 
reactive power, and active power. These parameters play a vital role in the resilience 
of distribution systems, especially in the presence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). 
Evaluation with simulated data shows that active and reactive power forecasts degrade 
notably with higher EV penetration, whereas voltage forecasting experiences less 
degradation across all scenarios.

## Key Contributions

1. **Probabilistic Forecasting Framework**: Developed for LV substation variables
2. **Multi-variable Prediction**: Simultaneous forecasting of voltage, reactive power, and active power
3. **Resilience Analysis**: Assessment under different DER penetration scenarios
4. **EV Impact Evaluation**: Analysis of electric vehicle integration effects

## Methods

The approach combines:
- Historical data analysis from LV substations
- Machine learning models for probabilistic forecasting
- Scenario analysis with varying DER penetration levels
- Performance metrics for forecasting accuracy

## Results

- Active and reactive power forecasts show significant degradation with high EV penetration
- Voltage forecasts remain relatively stable across scenarios
- The probabilistic framework provides confidence intervals for resilience planning
